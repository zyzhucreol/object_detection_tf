# TensorFlow object detection on a PC-based imaging system
Create and fine-tune an object detection model beyond those on the papers. The goal of this project is to physically deploy such a model on a PC with a camera and scientific imaging system.

# Useful resources
1. Installation instructions (especially helpful with the fix on pycocotool package: https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#tensorflow-object-detection-api-installation
2. Examples in the link above (using TF 2.X)
